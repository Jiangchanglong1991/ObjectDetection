1. Region Proposal method
1.1 Sliding Window(brute force)
Use windows with different size to scan the imgae from up to donw, left to right
pseudocodeï¼š
```python
for window in windows:
	patch = fetch_patch(image, window)
	results = detector(patch)
```
1.2 Selective Search
region proposal method
ROI region of interest

[Graph-Based Image Segmentation Paper](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~pff/papers/seg-ijcv.pdf) [Notes](https://blog.csdn.net/guoyunfei20/article/details/78727972)

Firstly, form some regions using color similarity. 
details: treat each image as a non-direction graph, distance between vertices are distance between pixels(I prefer HSV rather than RGB here). We set a Threshold to find MSTs(Minimum Spanning Tree) from them to form initial ROIs.

Then, we merge ROIs again based on  
color similarity, 
texture similarity,
size similarity,
shape compatibility measure,
